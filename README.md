# birthday.py
New to programming . Learning python with automate the boring stuff
I'm basically learning how git works and the best way is by practising and making mistakes . 
I initially wanted to share only the [birthday.py] file , but little did i know it's within another folder named [zeroDivide.py], hence when i pushed to github ,
everything pushed , i guess i've learnt how that particular git command works , it's a day at a time for me .
